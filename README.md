# Secured Area Verification System

This repository contains the source code and documentation for the Secured Area Verification System. This system utilizes an Arduino-based setup with various components such as RFID, IR sensor, keypad, servo, and an LCD to control access to a secured area.

## Overview

The Secured Area Verification System uses multiple components to control access to a secured area. The system incorporates RFID card detection, keypad input for password verification, and an IR sensor for detecting the presence of a person. A servo motor is used to control access, and an LCD provides user feedback.

## Components Used

- Arduino board
- MFRC522 RFID module
- IR sensor
- Keypad
- Servo motor
- LCD display

## System Functionality

The system's functionality includes:

- Detecting the presence of a person using the IR sensor.
- RFID card detection and verification.
- Password input and verification using the keypad.
- Controlling access to the secured area using the servo motor.
- Displaying user feedback and status updates on the LCD display.
